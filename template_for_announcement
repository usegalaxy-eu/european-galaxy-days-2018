Dear all 


We are happy to announce the European Galaxy Days which will be held 19 and 20 November 2018 in Freiburg, Germany.

Similar to the events we organized in 2016, 2014 and 2012 the aim is to discuss the status of the Galaxy project, 
new developments, interfaces to other systems, extensions and best practice in reproducible research.

The program is planed as follows: 

Monday, November 19th 
We intend to have a full day of talks from you. We especially encourage Galaxy User to present their work with Galaxy. 
Please indicate your interest in presenting when you register (we will then get in contact with you). Or contact us directly.

Tuesday, November 20th
This day is more on the technical side, with presentation, tutorials and hands on exercises. Currently we plan to discuss/present:
 - Galaxy and Machine learning
 - Single Cell RNA Seq analysis with Galaxy

Registration is now open (space is limited). There will be no conference fee. Though, you need to cover for your food and
